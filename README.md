## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- It was challenging to understand setting up the app using Vite and React. In terms of code, it was challenging to understand how Javascript and HTML work together 
in the JSX files. It was also challenging to use components for the first time. But I think the lab helped prepare me a lot for this assignment!
- I also had trouble getting the layout to look the way I wanted with CSS styling. But it was fun to try.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
